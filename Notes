Use percentages for widths NOT FIXED PIXELS

Use em for fonts

rem: root
em: as is <--- Problem when we nest things

Process not defined error?

Update this to 5.0.0 to resolve the issue

CSS position
A parent is needed >> p
A child follows under it >> c

Static: 
    follow the flow of other elements --> 1,2,3,4 You expect the element to go with that order

Relative: 
    Nearly the same as static
    Can change the top/left/right/bottom
    left: 10px <-- Left side is 10px away from the left
    Overflows!
    Won't push around static elements

    ? Now we have to move all of this down, so position relative isn't really used for top/left/right/bottom
    USEFUL to set an element relative as a parent for absolute

Relative <--> Absolute work together well

Absolute: Place posistion: absolute in child-one
    A ghost block?
    The other child IGNORE this
    Treat it like it doesn't even exist
    Good for when you want to stick something to it 
    top? ABSOLUTE POSITION OF THE PARENT CONTAINER
    The parent? Nope, it's static --> Need a position : realtive, aboslute, stiicky, fixed
    Now we have realtive a use case

Fixed: Nearly the same as absolute
    Ignores the parent element -- Even if they have a relative posisition

    FIXED to the entire HTML page
    Stays at the same place when we scroll

Sticky: Combination of relative/fixed into one
    A mini dynamic fixed position
    It's relative by default and becomes fixed when we scroll down
