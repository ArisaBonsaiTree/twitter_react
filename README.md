## Current Release v0.1.0
 In this project, I'll attempt to create a Twitter clone using React. I've attempted the same thing using just JS and I didn't have fun.
This time, I'll use the limited knowledge I have with React to create this 'website'

The project is created using ReactJs and using localStorage for the database.

Current features: Post tweets, like 'other' people tweets, view other people profile, and your own profile.

I plan on adding more features once I learn how to integrate MongoDB with ReactJs.
