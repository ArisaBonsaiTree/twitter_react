# Welcome to my 'Twitter' clone

## Update Log
2) Finally have a login and register page. You can actually see your name on the Tweets. You can also delete your own Tweets now
Plan on changing on how we authenticate and authorize users. The current model isn't really feasible and it's a good way to practice by making my own. By updating this, I plan to have a user profile page displayed in the next git push

1) Currently implementing a backend to the 'Twitter' clone

0) The current production/uploaded version is missing a lot of key features. Mostly missing a backend that will be implemented in a later patch sometime in the future

## Old Version

In this project, I'll attempt to create a Twitter clone using React. I've attempted the same thing using just JS and I didn't have fun.
This time, I'll use the limited knowledge I have with React to create this 'website'

The project is created using ReactJs and using localStorage for the database.

Current features: Post tweets, like 'other' people tweets, view other people profile, and your own profile.

I plan on adding more features once I learn how to integrate MongoDB with ReactJs.
